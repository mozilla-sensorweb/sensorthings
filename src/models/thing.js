/**
 * 8.2.1 Thing Entity
 *
 * The OGC SensorThings API follows the ITU-T definition, i.e., with
 * regard to the Internet of Things, a thing is an object of the physical
 * world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things) that
 * is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks
 * [ITU-T Y.2060].
 *
 * Properties of a Thing entity:
 *
 * + name (CharacterString) (One - mandatory)
 *   A property provides a label for Thing entity, commonly a descriptive
 *   name.
 *
 * + description (CharacterString) (One - mandatory)
 *   This is a short description of the corresponding Thing entity.
 *
 * + properties (JSON Object) (Zero-to-one)
 *   A JSON Object containing user-annotated properties as key-value pairs.
 *
 * Direct relation between a Thing entity and other entity types:
 *
 * + Location - Many optional to many optional.
 *   The Location entity locates the Thing. Multiple Things MAY be located at
 *   the same Location. A Thing MAY not have a Location. A Thing SHOULD have
 *   only one Location.
 *   However, in some complex use cases, a Thing MAY have more than one Location
 *   representations. In such case, the Thing MAY have more than one Locations.
 *   These Locations SHALL have different encodingTypes and the encodingTypes
 *   SHOULD be in different spaces (e.g., one encodingType in Geometrical space
 *   and one encodingType in Topological space).
 *
 * + HistoricalLocation - One mandatory to many optional.
 *   A Thing has zero-to-many HistoricalLocations. A HistoricalLocation has
 *   one-and-only-one Thing.
 *
 * + DataStream - One mandatory to many optional.
 *   A Thing MAY have zero-to-many Datastreams.
 *
