/**
 * 8.2.7 Observation
 *
 * An Observation is the act of measuring or otherwise determining the value of
 * a property [OGC 10-004r3 and ISO 19156:2011].
 *
 * Properties of an Observation entity:
 *
 * + phenomenonTime (TM_Period - ISO 8601 Time Interval) (One - mandatory)
 *   The time instant or period of when the Observation happens.
 *   Note: Many resource-constrained sensing devices do not have a clock.
 *   As a result, a client may omit phenonmenonTime when POST new Observations,
 *   even though phenonmenonTime is a mandatory property. When a SensorThings
 *   service receives a POST Observations without phenonmenonTime, the service
 *   SHALL assign the current server time to the value of the phenomenonTime.
 *
 * + result (Any) (One - mandatory)
 *   The estimated value of an ObservedProperty from the Observation.
 *
 * + resultTime (TM_Period - ISO 8601 Time Interval) (One - mandatory)
 *   The time of the Observation's result was generated.
 *   Note: Many resource-constrained sensing devices do not have a clock.
 *   As a result, a client may omit resultTime when POST new Observations,
 *   even though resultTime is a mandatory property. When a SensorThings service
 *   receives a POST Observations without resultTime, the service SHALL assign
 *   a null value to the resultTime.
 *
 * + resultQuality (DQ_Element) (Zero-to-many)
 *   Describes the quality of the result.
 *
 * + validTime (TM_Period - USON 8601 Time Interval) (Zero-to-one)
 *   The time period during which the result may be used.
 *
 * + parameters (NamedValues in a JSON Array) (Zero-to-one)
 *   Key-value pairs showing the environmental conditions during measurement.
 *
 * Direct relation between an Observation entity and other entity types:
 *
 * + Datastream - Many optional to one mandatory
 *   A Datastream can have zero-to-many Observations. One Observation SHALL
 *   occur in one-and-only-one Datastream.
 *
 * + FeatureOfInterest - Many optional to one mandatory
 *   An Observation observes on one-and-only-one FeatureOfInterest. One
 *   FeatureOfInterest could be observed by zero-to-many Observations.
