/**
 * 8.2.4 Datastream Entity
 *
 * A Datastream groups a collection of Observations measuring the same
 * ObservedProperty and produced by the same Sensor.
 *
 * Properties of a Datastream entity:
 *
 * + name (CharacterString) (One - mandatory)
 *   A property provides a label for Datastream entity,
 *   commonly a descriptive name.
 *
 * + description (CharacterString) (One - mandatory)
 *   The description about the Datastream.
 *
 * + unitOfMeasurement (JSON Object) (One - mandatory)
 *   A JSON Object containing three key-value pairs. The name property
 *   presents the full name of the unitOfMeasurement; the symbol property
 *   shows the textual form of the unit symbol; and the definition contains
 *   the URI defining the unitOfMeasurement.
 *   The values of these properties SHOULD follow the Unified Code for Unit
 *   of Measure (UCUM).
 *
 * + observationType (ValueCode) (One - mandatory)
 *   The type of Observation (with unique result type), which is used by the
 *   service to encode observations.
 *   Can be OM_CategoryObservation (URI), OM_CountObservation (integer),
 *   OM_Measurement (double), OM_Observation (Any) or OM_TruthObservation
 *   (boolean).
 *
 * + observedArea (GM_Envelope - GeoJSON Polygon) (Zero-to-one - optional)
 *   The spatial bounding box of the spatial extent of all FeaturesOfInterest
 *   that belong to the Observations associated with this Datastream.
 *
 * + phenomenonTime (TM_Period - ISO 8601 Time Interval) (Zero-to-one optional)
 *   The temporal interval of the phenomenon times of all observations belonging
 *   to this Datastream.
 *
 * + resultTime (TM_Period - ISO 8601 Time Interval) (Zero-to-one optional)
 *   The temporal interval of the result times of all observations belonging to
 *   this Datastream.
 *
 * Direct relation between a Datastream entity and other
 * entity types:
 *
 * + Thing - Many optional to one mandatory
 *   A Thing has zero-to-many Datastreams. A Datastream entity SHALL only link
 *   to a Thing as a collection of Observations.
 *
 * + Sensor - Many optional to one mandatory
 *   The Observations in a Datastream are performed by one-and-only-one Sensor.
 *   One Sensor MAY produce zero-to-many Observations in different Datastreams.
 *
 * + ObservedProperty - Many optional to one mandatory
 *   The Observations of a Datastream SHALL observe the same ObservedProperty.
 *   The Observations of different Datastreams MAY observe the same
 *   ObservedProperty.
 *
 * + Observation - One mandatory to many optional
 *   A Datastream has zero-to-many Observations. One Observation SHALL occur in
 *   one-and-only-one Datastream.
