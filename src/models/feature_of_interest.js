/**
 * 8.2.8 FeatureOfInterest Entity
 *
 * An Observation results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon.
 * The phenomenon is a property of a feature, the latter being the
 * FeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC and ISO 19156:2011].
 * In the context of the Internet of Things, many Observationsâ€™
 * FeatureOfInterest can be the Location of the Thing. For example,
 * the FeatureOfInterest of a wifi-connect thermostat can be the
 * Location of the thermostat (i.e., the living room where the
 * thermostat is located in). In the case of remote sensing, the
 * FeatureOfInterest can be the geographical area or volume that
 * is being sensed.
 *
 * Properties of a FeatureOfInterest entity:
 *
 * + name (CharacterString) (One - mandatory)
 *   A property provides a label for FeatureOfInterest entity,
 *   commonly a descriptive name.
 *
 * + description (CharacterString) (One - mandatory)
 *   The description about the FeatureOfInterest.
 *
 * + encodingType (ValueCode) (One - mandatory)
 *   The encoding type of the feature property.
 *
 * + feature (Any) (One - mandatory)
 *   The detailed description of the feature.
 *   The data type is defined by encodingType.
 *
 * Direct relation between a FeatureOfInterest entity and other
 * entity types:
 *
 * + Observation - One mandatory to many optional
 *   An Observation observes on one-and-only-one FeatureOfInterest.
 *   One FeatureOfInterest could be observed by zero-to-many Observations.
